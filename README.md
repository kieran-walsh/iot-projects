# iot-projects
A sample of my coursework from 95-733 Internet of Things

### About the projects
- Selected work from two sections of the course: Ajax/websockets and MQTT/PubSub

#### Ajax/websockets
- Used Ajax and websockets to build web interfaces that update automatically or upon user request
- Example 1: A simple shopping cart app, implemented with Ajax and a Java Servlet
- Example 2: An app to track connections to a Servlet from Argon microcontrollers (Ajax)
- Example 3: Same shopping cart app as Example 1 but built with websockets

#### MQTT/Publish-Subscribe
- Example 1: Using MQTT to receive data sent out by the Particle Argon
- Example 2: Subscribing to a dice rolling program and displaying the results with Google Charts
- Example 3: Mouse-tracking client
